# Vehicle-Analysis-CSC232
I created a Car Analysis project for my Object Oriented Software Development course that allows the user to undertake partial routine vehicle checkups. 

A Java Object-Oriented project that, like a vehicle workshop, asks the user for particular information about their vehicle. After inputting the information, the user can get an analysis of their vehicle's average annual miles, miles per gallon, miles left, and a general fuel efficiency status check.
